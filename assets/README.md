# The Land RPG - Game Assets

This directory contains all visual and audio assets for The Land RPG.

## Sprites

All sprite files are located in the `sprites/` directory.

### Current Sprites (Programmatically Generated)

The following sprites were created programmatically as placeholders:

- **player.png** (30x30) - Player character sprite (green character with eyes)
- **tree_active.png** (40x40) - Active tree with green foliage
- **tree_chopped.png** (40x40) - Tree stump after being chopped
- **enemy.png** (35x35) - Enemy creature sprite (red hostile)

**License:** These programmatically generated sprites are public domain (CC0). Created specifically for this project.

**Source:** Generated by `scripts/create_sprites.py` using Pygame drawing functions.

## Graceful Fallback

The game is designed to work even without sprite files. If sprites are missing or fail to load:

- **Player**: Falls back to green square
- **Tree (active)**: Falls back to brown square
- **Tree (chopped)**: Falls back to faded brown square
- **Enemy**: Falls back to red square with HP bar

This ensures the game remains playable during development or if assets are unavailable.

## Future Assets

Planned additions for future versions:

- Sound effects (tree chop, combat hits, level up)
- Background music
- UI elements (buttons, panels, icons)
- Additional entity sprites (fishing spots, mining nodes, etc.)
